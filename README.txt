# Improving user experience through the development of an advanced movie recommendation system.


## Overview
The MovieLens dataset (ml-latest-small) provides insights into 5-star rating and free-text tagging activities from MovieLens, a popular movie recommendation service. The dataset encompasses 100,836 ratings and 3,683 tag applications across 9,742 movies. These records were generated by 610 users from March 29, 1996, to September 24, 2018. The dataset version being referred to was created on September 26, 2018.

Users were randomly selected for inclusion in the dataset, with a prerequisite that each user had rated at least 20 movies. No demographic information about the users is included. A unique ID represents each user, and no other user-specific data is provided.

The dataset is composed of four CSV files: `links.csv`, `movies.csv`, `ratings.csv`, and `tags.csv`. Detailed information about the contents and the utilization of these files is provided below.

## Dataset Structure and Information

### User IDs
- User IDs are anonymized and consistent across `ratings.csv` and `tags.csv`.

### Movie IDs
- Only movies with at least one rating or tag are included in the dataset.
- Movie IDs are consistent with those used on the MovieLens website.
- Consistency across `ratings.csv`, `tags.csv`, `movies.csv`, and `links.csv`.

### Ratings Data (ratings.csv)
- Format: userId, movieId, rating, timestamp
- Ratings are on a 5-star scale with half-star increments (0.5 stars - 5.0 stars).
- Timestamps are in seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.

### Tags Data (tags.csv)
- Format: userId, movieId, tag, timestamp
- Tags are user-generated metadata about movies.
- Timestamps are in seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.

### Movies Data (movies.csv)
- Format: movieId, title, genres
- Movie titles include the release year in parentheses.
- Genres are pipe-separated.

### Links Data (links.csv)
- Format: movieId, imdbId, tmdbId
- Links to other movie data sources.

### Cross-Validation
- Cross-fold computation is not bundled with the dataset.
- Refer to modern toolkits or LensKit for guidance and tools for cross-folding approaches.

## Objectives
### Main Objective
Discuss the development of a system that provides personalized movie recommendations.

### Specific Objectives
1. Determine the most effective method for recommending movies to users and improving their satisfaction.
2. Implement strategies to encourage users to share their movie preferences.
3. Strike a balance between using user preferences and movie attributes to generate the best recommendations.
4. Identify the features and aspects crucial for building an effective recommendation model.
5. Optimize the recommendation system to provide the most relevant and personalized movie suggestions.


## Findings
1. **Total Count of Movie Ratings:**
   - Only a few movies have ratings below average (2.5), suggesting that the movies are well-received.

2. **Frequency of Movies Released per Year:**
   - Advancements in technology have contributed to a notable increase in movie production, particularly in the mid-1990s.
